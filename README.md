Web App Single Page Project

My idea is to create a simple single page web app.
Sort of like a template for a simple website for family and/ or friends.

This one will be my version 1.0.
Test case with dummy text and content and the one I can clone from.

Also this project will teach me:

- how to use Github with VSC
- make a web app
- get better ar SCSS
- get better at JavaScript
- make an instagram feed (instafeed.js)
- use pwa functionality
- host a page on github
