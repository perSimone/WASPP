Web App Single Page Project

My idea is to create a simple single page web app. 
Sort of like a template for a simple website for family and/ or friends. 

This one will be my version 1.0. 
Test case with dummy text and content and the one I can clone from. 

Also this project will teach me: 
- how to use Github with VSC
- make a web app
- make an instagram feed 
- use pwa functionality
- host a page on github
